# Module 03 Mini-Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Building a simple game using only Javascript.

## Acceptance Criteria

The completed application should meet the following criteria:

* As a user, I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.

* As a user, I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.

* As a user, I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.

* As a user, I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.

* As a user, I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after each round.

## Additional Work

* I want the rock-paper-scissors game to be playable through an HTML interface, rather than through browser prompts and alert messages.
